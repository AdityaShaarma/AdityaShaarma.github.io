<h1>Homework 5: Bigfoot Sightings Visualization</h1>

<h2>Visualization 1: Bigfoot Sightings by State</h2>
<div id="chart1"></div>

<p>
This bar chart visualizes the total number of reported Bigfoot sightings per U.S. state. 
It provides an overview of which states have the highest frequency of reports.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Encodings:</strong> The x-axis encodes <code>state</code> as a nominal variable, and the y-axis encodes the count of 
records as a quantitative variable (<code>count():Q</code>). Each bar’s color is also mapped to <code>state</code> using a categorical colormap, 
which helps visually separate each bar and prevents monotony.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Color map:</strong> The default categorical color scheme provides high contrast and evenly distributed hues across states, 
helping viewers distinguish between bars. Since the data represents discrete categories (states), a continuous colormap would 
not be appropriate here.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Transformations:</strong> I used Vega-Lite’s built-in aggregation <code>count()</code> instead of manually grouping in pandas, 
allowing Altair to automatically compute total counts per state. This simple aggregation was enough because we only needed 
state-level counts.

<h2>Visualization 2: Interactive Sightings per Year (Selected State)</h2>
<div id="chart2"></div>

<p>
This plot shows how Bigfoot sightings in a specific state have changed over time. 
A dropdown menu allows viewers to choose a state, making the visualization interactive and focused on a single region at a time.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Encodings:</strong> The x-axis encodes <code>year</code> as a temporal variable, and the y-axis encodes <code>count():Q</code>. 
The <code>color</code> channel maps each point to its <code>state</code> for clarity, and the <code>size</code> encoding is conditioned on the selected 
state using <code>alt.condition(sel, alt.value(100), alt.value(20))</code>. This highlights the selected state visually.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Color map:</strong> A categorical colormap is again used because each state is a distinct category. 
When a single state is selected, its color remains consistent across all years, maintaining interpretability.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Transformations:</strong> In the Python notebook, I extracted the year from the <code>date</code> column using pandas 
(<code>df['year'] = df['date'].dt.year</code>) and grouped the data by state and year to prepare it for visualization.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Interactivity:</strong> The dropdown selection parameter (<code>alt.selection_point</code>) lets the viewer choose a specific 
state to highlight. This improves clarity and engagement, allowing exploration of year-by-year changes while filtering out noise 
from other states.
